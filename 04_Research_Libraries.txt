- **pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.

## Logging Libraries
- **logging**: The standard logging library for Python.
- **loguru**: A library that provides an easier logging experience in Python.

## Packaging Libraries
- **PyInstaller**: Converts Python applications into stand-alone executables.
- **cx_Freeze**: A set of scripts and modules for freezing Python scripts into executables.
- **Nuitka**: A Python-to-C++ compiler that can produce stand-alone executables.

## Testing Libraries
- **pytest**: A framework to write simple and scalable test cases.
- **pytest-cov**: A plugin for measuring code coverage.
- **pytest-qt**: A plugin for testing PyQt applications with pytest.

## Utility Libraries
